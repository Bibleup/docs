# Copyright Notice
BibleUp does not store or process Bible texts or translations but rather relies on the services of third-party API providers. We use various third-party API to process and retrieve Bible texts and thus, have no direct control over how the texts are stored and distributed.

[API.Bible](https://scripture.api.bible) is BibleUp's core API provider. We fetch the Bible texts of the KJV, ASV, WEB and LSV from this provider. These versions are open-access texts and can be used and distributed freely. However, for other modern translations fetched from other API providers like [Bolls.life](https://bolls.life), there are limitations to how they can be used.

2. Quote permissions for modern versions are restricted only to non-commercial projects.
