# Contribute
BibleUp is completely free and open-source. We believe everyone should be involved in its development in as many ways as possible.<br><br>
Contributions can be made by anyone and everyone. We accept contributions in many different forms whether as a developer, blogger, reviewer or even as an organisation. Contributors are always recognised.

## Developer
You can be part of the development team by contributing technically to BibleUp. You can contribute to any of the derivative projects and even to BibleUp Core. All projects and repositories can be found on the Github organisation page.

## Blogger
Thank you for using BibleUp! <br>
You can help others find BibleUp using your contents.<br>
To do this, kindly consider using the closing part of a blog post to talk about your adoption of BibleUp for reference tagging. You can simply describe your experience with BibleUp and how it has helped your blog. A link to BibleUp homepage will be great! <br><br>
This doesn't have to take more than a few paragraphs. If you prefer to do this as a sort of announcement to your readers, you could dedicate a post for it.
