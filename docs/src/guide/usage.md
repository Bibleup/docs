# Usage
After installation, create an instance of `BibleUp` by passing an element and the required `options` object into it. BibleUp exposes a single object interface which is `new BibleUp()`.

``` js
let bibleup = new BibleUp(element, options)
```

**element** - This is the HTML element containing Bible references. This could be the entire `document.body`, browser window or a particular element you want BibleUp to search through.

**options**  - This is an object that should contain all BibleUp options and configurations. BibleUp options will be discussed in the next section.


When you are done with configuring `BibleUp`, put it to work by calling the `create()` method

``` js {2}
let bibleup = new BibleUp(element, options);
bibleup.create();
```

BibleUp will transform all valid Bible references to links. Hover or click on the link to get the Bible text ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

For an example of BibleUp options:

``` js
let body = document.body
let bibleup = new BibleUp(body, {
version: "KJV", 
popup: "classic"
})

bibleup.create()
```
Check next section for full list of options properties

## Methods
The `new BibleUp` instance exports only two method. One standard method and a *getter*

### `create()`
The `create()` method is used to put BibleUp to work after the config options are passed to the instance. This method accepts no arguments and does not return any value. It is used to *activate* BibleUp.

``` js {2} 
const b = new BibleUp(element, options);
b.create()
```

### `getOptions`
This is a *getter* method to retrieve the current BibleUp config options. It returns all options as an `object`.

``` js {2} 
const b = new BibleUp(element, options);
console.log(b.getOptions)
```
