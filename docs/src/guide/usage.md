# Usage
After installation, create an instance of BibleUp by passing an element and the required `options` object into it. BibleUp exposes a single class object `new BibleUp()`.

``` js
let bibleup = new BibleUp(element, options)
```

- **element** - This is the HTML element containing Bible references. This could be the entire `document.body` or a particular element you want BibleUp to search through.

- **options**  - This an object should contain all BibleUp options and configurations. BibleUp options will be discussed in the next section.


When you are done with configuring `BibleUp`, put it to work by calling the `create()` method

``` js {2}
let bibleup = new BibleUp(element, options);
bibleup.create();
```

BibleUp will now transform all valid Bible references to links. Hover or click on the link to get the Bible text ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

## Usage Example
For a minimal example of BibleUp options and usage:

``` js
let body = document.body
let bibleup = new BibleUp(body, {
version: "KJV", 
popup: "classic", 
darkTheme: false
})

bibleup.create()
```
Check the next section for the full list of all option properties.
