# Introduction

## What is BibleUp? 
BibleUp is a configurable web tool that transforms plain Bible references on a webpage into hyperlinks. Hovering on these links will make the corresponding Bible text accessible via a feature-rich and flexible popover.<br>
BibleUp removes the need of switching to a different tab or app to look up plain Bible references on a webpage. It makes the text accessible to readers on the go.

BibleUp supports customisation of links, popovers and versions - all done through the API options.

## How it works
BibleUp searches for all valid Bible references on a page and transforms each one to a link. Hovering or clicking on these links will make the corresponding Bible text accessible via a feature-rich and flexible popover.
<br><br>
BibleUp does this by searching through the entire page (or specific sections) for valid Bible references. It then transforms these references to an `<a>` element, intercepting clicks and hover events and then fetching the Bible text via the internal API. The text is displayed on a flexible and highly customisable popover.
At its core, BibleUp is a blend of an internal API and a display interface.

## Browser Support
You can install BibleUp on virtually all browsers and operating systems. The default build supports an extensive list of browsers. <br>The last 3 major versions of all browsers are fully supported with an extended support for Chromium-based browsers, iOS Safari and Internet Explorer 11.
