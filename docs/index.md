## What is BibleUp?
BibleUp is a configurable web tool that transforms plain Bible references on a webpage into hyperlinks. Hovering on these links will make the corresponding Bible text accessible via a feature-rich and flexible popover.<br>
BibleUp removes the need of switching to a different tab or app to look up plain Bible references on a webpage. It makes the text accessible to readers on the go.

BibleUp supports customisation of links, popovers and versions - all done through the API options.

## How it works
BibleUp efficiency runs through the DOM in an HTML page (or specific sections) and checks for all text nodes looking like a standard Bible reference. It uses a custom regex ([BibleUp Regex](/guide/development)) to test for resemblance and proceed to check if the reference chapters and verse range are indeed valid. Valid references are then, respectively, matched with the book of the Bible to which they relate and transformed to an hyperlink (`</a>`)

The popover is created and appended to the page from the options provided to BibleUp and styled in that same manner also. Hovering or clicking on BibleUp links will fetch the Bible text from the external API and make it accessible via a feature-rich and flexible popover.

At its core, BibleUp is a blend of an internal API and a display interface.

## Browser Support
BibleUp supports an extensive list of browsers and operating systems. <br>
