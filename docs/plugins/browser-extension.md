# BibleUp Browser Extension
There is an official BibleUp browser extension for Chromium-based browsers that can be used on any website. The extension is currently in a public beta and will be available on the Chrome store soon. <br><br> We only support Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, Valvadi, e.t.c). The extension will be made compatible with Mozilla Firefox in future releases.

## Usage
Thank you for installing BibleUp!<br><br>
To configure the options, simply click on the extension icon to open the options page and select the option to **Set Style manually** or **Paste Config** from the BibleUp Editor. Click on the save button once you are done.
<br><br>

### Activate BibleUp
Click on **Activate BibleUp** button to activate BibleUp then reload the current webpage to see BibleUp in action.<br><br> BibleUp automatically keeps working even when you navigate to a different webpage so you only have to reload the webpage once after activation.

### De-activate BibleUp
Click on **Deactivate BibleUp** button to stop BibleUp from running. The reference tagging should be gone when you reload the page. BibleUp will also stop running automatically when you load a different webpage.

### Refresh BibleUp
BibleUp works correctly on most websites and even on single-page applications (SPA) that constantly refreshes content without a browser reload (like Gmail, Facebook, Reddit e.t.c). <br><br> However, to reload BibleUp on your current webpage without having to do a full browser refresh, simply click the **reload** icon near the activate button. This is useful if you change BibleUp options and want it to immediately apply to tagged references.
